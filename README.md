### Abastract
Automatic assessment of learning is a process where the computer system automatically generates test i
tems and evaluates the responses. Image is one of the major media to assess learning capabilities. 
In this article, we have proposed a system with a dataset containing images used to evaluate the kid’s 
ability to answer pictorial questions. The system tests a set of skills such as counting ability, 
color concept, and knowledge of objects and geometric shapes. It utilized a pipeline of RCNN and LSTM 
bridging with an object knowledge layer for generating question–answer pairs and achieved promising results. 
We benchmarked our dataset with state-of-the-art deep learning methods and assessed the performance of 
generating question–answer pairs from a given image. The source code and the dataset are
